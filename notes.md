What is redux :
-Redux is a predictable state container library, primarily used for managing application state in JavaScript apps, especially those built with React. It helps you manage how data flows through the application by storing the entire state in a single, centralized object called the “store.” Changes to this store are made in a predictable way using actions and reducers, allowing developers to reason about the application state at any time.

Redux Toolkit in React JS
-Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended approach for efficiently building Redux logic in modern React applications. It provides a set of opinionated tools and abstractions to simplify state management, reduce boilerplate, and enable best practices.

What Does Redux Toolkit Do?
-Redux Toolkit wraps and enhances the core Redux library by providing:
-Simplified Store Setup: Configure a Redux store with good defaults, automatic middleware, and Redux DevTools integration out of the box.
-Slice Reducers: Create and organize actions and reducers using the createSlice utility, which generates both reducer logic and action creators for you.
-Immutable State Updates: Lets you write “mutative” code for reducers, using the Immer library internally to manage immutable state safely.
-Built-in Thunks: Handle asynchronous logic and side effects with createAsyncThunk, streamlining the most common async patterns.
-Standardized Patterns: Encourages code organization and conventions aligned with the latest Redux best practices.

Why Use Redux Toolkit?
-Removes Boilerplate: Minimizes repetitive code by auto-generating actions and reducers.
-Official Best Practice: RTK is now the standard/recommended way to write Redux logic in new applications.
-Easy Integration: Works seamlessly with React via the react-redux bindings and hooks.
